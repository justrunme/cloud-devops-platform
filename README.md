# Cloud-Native GitOps Platform with ArgoCD, Terraform, Monitoring & Security

This project demonstrates a complete cloud-native infrastructure built from scratch using modern DevOps and DevSecOps practices. The platform is designed to be deployed locally on Minikube/Kind or in a cloud environment.

## 🌟 Overview

We create a demo DevOps infrastructure that includes:
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform.
- **Automated Application Deployment** using ArgoCD and GitOps principles.
- **Integrated Monitoring** with Prometheus + Grafana.
- **Security Auditing** with Trivy, kube-bench, and kubescape.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** powered by GitHub Actions.
- **Report & Dashboard Visualization**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

| Goal          | Description                                                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitOps**    | Deploy applications via `git push` managed by ArgoCD.                    |
| **IaC**       | Define cluster, Helm charts, ingress, and monitoring as code with Terraform. |
| **CI/CD**     | Automate checks and deployments with GitHub Actions.                     |
| **Security**  | Generate a `SECURITY-REPORT.md` using Trivy, kube-bench, and kubescape.  |
| **Monitoring**| Set up Prometheus and Grafana with pre-configured dashboards.            |
| **Docs**      | Provide a clear README with screenshots of dashboards and audit results. |

## ✅ Why This Project is Valuable

| Factor          | Importance                                                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**    | DevSecOps is a top-demand skill for hiring.                   |
| **GitOps**      | ArgoCD/Flux are the leading tools in the 2024-2025 tech stack.|
| **Terraform**   | Infrastructure as Code is a must-have skill.                  |
| **Observability**| Prometheus + Grafana is the industry standard.                |
| **CI/CD**       | Demonstrates the ability to automate an end-to-end pipeline.  |
| **Documentation**| Crucial for any open-source or portfolio project.             |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Deployment Options

1.  **Local:** Via Minikube or Kind.
2.  **Cloud (Optional):** Via Terraform on AWS (EKS).

### Prerequisites

*   [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) or [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
*   [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
*   [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-devops-platform.git
    cd cloud-devops-platform
    ```

2.  **Initialize Terraform:**
    ```sh
    cd terraform
    terraform init
    ```

3.  **Apply Terraform configuration:**
    ```sh
    terraform apply
    ```

## 📊 Generating Reports and Visualizations

To fulfill the project goals, you will need to generate the following:

### Grafana Dashboard Screenshot (`REPORTS/grafana.png`)

1.  Once Grafana is deployed and running (via `terraform apply`),
    access the Grafana UI. You can usually port-forward the Grafana service:
    ```sh
    kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000
    ```
2.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
3.  Log in (default credentials are `admin`/`admin`, you will be prompted to change the password).
4.  Navigate to the "Kubernetes cluster" dashboard (it should be automatically imported).
5.  Take a screenshot of the dashboard and save it as `REPORTS/grafana.png`.

### Security Audit Results (`REPORTS/audit-results/`)

After running the CI/CD pipeline (which includes Trivy, kube-bench, and Kubescape):

1.  **Trivy:** The `run_trivy.sh` script will output a summary. For detailed reports, you might need to run `trivy k8s --report all cluster > REPORTS/audit-results/trivy-report.txt` locally.
2.  **kube-bench:** The `kube-bench-results.txt` file generated by the CI/CD job should be moved to `REPORTS/audit-results/kube-bench-report.txt`.
3.  **Kubescape:** The `SECURITY-REPORT.md` generated by the CI/CD job should be moved to `REPORTS/audit-results/kubescape-report.md`.

Remember to commit these generated files to your repository to showcase your project's outputs.

## 🔑 GitHub Actions Kubeconfig Setup

For the CI/CD pipeline to interact with your Kubernetes cluster (for `kube-bench` and `kubescape`),
you need to provide your `kubeconfig` as a GitHub Secret.

1.  **Get your kubeconfig:**
    ```sh
    cat ~/.kube/config | base64
    ```
2.  **Add as GitHub Secret:**
    *   Go to your GitHub repository settings.
    *   Navigate to `Settings` -> `Secrets and variables` -> `Actions`.
    *   Click `New repository secret`.
    *   Name it `KUBECONFIG_BASE64`.
    *   Paste the base64 encoded output from step 1 into the `Value` field.

3.  **Update `ci-cd.yml` (if not already done):**
    Ensure your `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` includes steps to decode and use this secret:
    ```yaml
          - name: Set up Kubeconfig
            env:
              KUBECONFIG_BASE64: ${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG_BASE64 }}
            run: |
              mkdir -p ~/.kube
              echo "$KUBECONFIG_BASE64" | base64 --decode > ~/.kube/config
              chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
    ```
